    The Solar System is home to the human race. In their many years of
    exploration, they have only been able to tap into a small amount of the
    knowledge the cosmos offers. However, they know more about what is in space
    than they know of what is in their oceans! In their defense, itâ€™s much
    easier to deal with low pressure situations than extremely high-pressure
    situations like the ones found under the deep ocean, but I digress. Click
    through the different plants to learn a few fun facts in the menu above!
